# Sketch 10: Chain of Events Game


**Create a Unity game based on the illustrated plans of a classmate's "chain of events."**

## Rules

Your sketch will include:

1. A library of original sprites based on the objects depicted in your classmate's illustration. You may include moving objects, static objects,  background scenery -- whatever you will need to use. Animated sprites should be saved as PNG sprite sheets (all frames saved in a grid in a single image file). Use Piskel, Photoshop, or any other sprite generating software to create these elements.  Load all sprites into a Unity Project, storing all sprites in a folder called "Sprites" within your "Assets" directory.
2. A Unity project (folder containing all project files, assets and scene)

## Learning Objectives
1. Gain familiarity with basic components of game design in Unity Software: Game Engine physics, colliders, rigid body materials, sprite creation, asset management.
2. Craft embedded narrative elements within a videogame.
3. Consider and compare the creative challenges of game design (what you did for Sketch #9) and game development (what you are doing for Sketch #10).

## Tips
1. You should attempt to be faithful to the creative spirit of your classmate's sketch. But don't worry about getting things to be exactly right.  You will have to make alterations and interpretations in order to actualize a raw concept. This is a creative act.
2. When things get too complicated, scale back.
